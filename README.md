# **Volcano Exploration**
Our webpage can be accessed [here](https://jaryan77.github.io/volcano_pt3/index.html)


The purpose of this project was to explore the various relationships between volcano size, magnitude, mortality, and time of explosion. We utilized different techniques for visualizing the data collected. Work was done independently for each visualization, which I then combined on a custom bootstrap website. 

Tools Utilized: HTML, Javascript, Plotly, ChartJS, D3, Leaflet

The initial data was pulled from a public opendatasoft API. VEI (volcanic explosivity index, volcano name, location, year, and mortality rates were extracted from the data)

Each member took a visualization, I was responsible for learning an additional visualization tool, for which i chose ChartJS. I chose it to give me an interactive way to display frequency and severity in the 4 time quadrants I had established.

All results were compiled and presented in class.
